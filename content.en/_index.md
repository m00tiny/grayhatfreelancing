# Gray Hat Freelancing Blog

{{< columns >}}
## Happy Holidays!

Gray Hat Freelancing is on a break until after the new year. We have had a
wonderful year here; made tons of progress in every direction that we could
hope for. And, we're happy to check out for now. And just reward ourselves
by not paying any attention for a brief moment. So long, 2022..

## Coming.. 2023..

We're gearing up to a do a huge focus on mobile in 2023. Starting with Android,
obviously. And we'll be sure to cover some much needed iOS stuff as well.  This
this moment in time is something I'd always been looking forward to. Getting
started, I'd dreamed of a time when basically everything was forcibly connected.

## Tempora nisi nunc

Lorem **markdownum** emicat gestu. Cannis sol pressit ducta. **Est** Idaei,
tremens ausim se tutaeque, illi ulnis hausit, sed, lumina cutem. Quae avis
sequens!

    if (backup + system) {

## Locis suis novi cum suoque decidit eadem

Idmoniae ripis, at aves, ali missa adest, ut _et autem_, et ab?
