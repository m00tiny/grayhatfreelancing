      <description>Ooooooh, yeah. I did it, because the range hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed for over a fucking year. That&amp;rsquo;s lazy on their part. The security industry evolves, your ranges should too. Here, I will be using https://caido.io/ instead of Burp or ZAProxy for this&amp;hellip; why? No particular reason. Just to be fair and showcase that such a thing exists. There&amp;rsquo;s also Charles, and many others.
&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;plaintext&amp;gt; - Breaks the search feature, there&amp;rsquo;s cross site scripting here.</description>

      <description>Updating Github Repos # println(&amp;ldquo;Hamming difference of: ${count}&amp;quot;)It&amp;rsquo;s been a nuisance to create your own or fork another, clone it, update the remotes for SSH and then get back to business. This reference is just a quick 1, 2, 3&amp;hellip; to-do/check list of steps for ease of reference!
Create repository on Github - Go to the website and just create one using their form, get the empty skeleton Clone repository - git clone &amp;lt;your repo&amp;gt; Remove remotes - git remote remove origin Add SSH remotes - git remote add origin git@github.</description>

      <description>Task 1 | Connection # https://tryhackme.com/room/olympusroom is a medium difficulty room on [https://tryhackme.com/](TryHackMe training platform) by Gavroche.
It&amp;rsquo;s primary focus is sql injection, in my opinion, with a slant on enumeration and systems comprehension.
We&amp;rsquo;re going to get started by adding olympus.thm to our /etc/hosts file to assist with enumeration.. this is recommended in the description and I&amp;rsquo;ve adopted it as a solid sign that we&amp;rsquo;ll need to do subdomain enumeration.</description>
